# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

This is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** UI implemented using **React.js**. The project is designed to provide an easy-to-use admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions. The goal is to create a secure and flexible system for administrators to assign roles to users, define permissions, and manage their status efficiently.

## Features

1. **User Management:**
   - View, add, edit, and delete users.
   - Assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).
   
2. **Role Management:**
   - Define and edit roles.
   - Assign permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) or custom attributes to roles.
   
3. **Dynamic Permissions:**
   - Modify and assign permissions to roles dynamically.
   - Permissions are clearly displayed for ease of understanding and modification.
   
4. **Mock API Simulation:**
   - Simulated API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
   - Server responses are simulated to validate the functionality.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1904naman/vrv-f1
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd vrv-f
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
